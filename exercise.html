        <p>1. Write HTML code that shows the following text.</p>
        <p><b>Theorem:</b> Every prime number (greater than 2)<em> modulo</em> 4 can be written in the form<em> 4n + 1</em> or<em> 4n + 3.</em></p>
        <p><b>Proof:</b> Any number p when divided by 4 leaves remainder 0, 1, 2 or 3. Therefore, the number has the form<em> 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2 or 4n + 3.</em> Since<em> 4n </em>and <em> 4n + 2</em> are<br><strong>even,</strong> so these can not be a form of a prime number which is an<strong> odd</strong> number (except 2). This proves the theorem. &#9744;</p>

    <h1>Solving Equations in Two Variables with Python</h1>

    <p>Understanding how to solve equations in two variables is an important skill in algebra. Let's go through the process step by step and then implement a simple Python program to solve such equations.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the Equations:</strong> Start with a system of two equations in the form \(ax + by = c\).</li>
        <li><strong>Select a Method:</strong> There are various methods to solve such systems. Here, we'll focus on substitution.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve for One Variable:</strong> Choose one equation and solve it for one variable in terms of the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Substitute:</strong> Substitute the expression obtained in the previous step into the other equation.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve:</strong> Solve the resulting equation to find the value of the variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-Substitute:</strong> Substitute the found value back into one of the original equations to find the other variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Verify the solution by checking it in both original equations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example:</h2>

    <p>Consider the following system of equations:</p>

    <p class="equation">
        \(2x + 3y = 8\)<br>
        \(4x - 2y = 6\)
    </p>

    <p>Choose the first equation and solve for \(x\):</p>

    <p class="equation">
        \(2x = 8 - 3y\)<br>
        \(x = 4 - \frac{3}{2}y\)
    </p>

    <p>Substitute \(x = 4 - \frac{3}{2}y\) into the second equation:</p>

    <p class="equation">
        \(4(4 - \frac{3}{2}y) - 2y = 6\)
    </p>

    <p>Solving the resulting equation gives \(y = 2\). Substitute \(y = 2\) back into the first equation to find \(x = 1\).</p>

    <h2>Python Program:</h2>

    <p>Now, let's implement a Python program that solves equations in two variables:</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="python">
            # Coefficients
            a1, b1, c1 = 2, 3, 8
            a2, b2, c2 = 4, -2, 6

            # Solve for x in terms of y
            x_in_terms_of_y = (c1 - b1 * y) / a1

            # Substitute x_in_terms_of_y into the second equation
            equation = a2 * x_in_terms_of_y + b2 * y - c2

            # Solve the resulting equation for y
            solution_y = equation / 2

            # Substitute y back into the first equation to find x
            solution_x = (c1 - b1 * solution_y) / a1

            # Verify the solution by checking it in both equations
            check1 = a1 * solution_x + b1 * solution_y == c1
            check2 = a2 * solution_x + b2 * solution_y == c2

            print("Solution:", solution_x, solution_y)
            print("Verification:", check1 and check2)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This Python program is a basic example. In real-world scenarios, consider using specialized libraries or more robust methods for solving equations.</p>
